## Hello, sbt!

This project demonstrates how to write a hello world in the sbt programming
language. Even with such a simple example, the superiority of sbt over Scala is
obvious: you do not need to wrap methods in `object` or `class`, this is much
simpler!

To compile this project, just run sbt:
```
$ sbt
```
This will launch the sbt REPL, a rich interactive programming environment packed
with features, but running your code is still as simple as typing:
```
> run
```
